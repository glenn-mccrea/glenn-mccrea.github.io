## Glenn McCrea

As a motivated software development student from Launchcode’s Software Development program, I bring a dynamic skill set in front-end and emerging back-end technologies, with hands-on experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. Through training, I have developed technical skills in building responsive web applications and am currently expanding my expertise into Java and back-end development. I have extensive experience with audio production, audio software, and digital sound mixers / audio processors. I am seeking an entry-level software development role that offers opportunities to apply my technical skills, continue learning, and contribute to innovative software solutions.
